**return value:** The result or output of a function if it contains a return statement (return keyword followed by a variable, expression, or value)   

**return statement:** The line of code beginning with the `return` keyword, which terminates a function and returns its value.  
  
**dead code:** Part of a program that can never run, possibly because it appears after a return statement.  
  
**None:** Python keyword that indicates no value.  This keyword is returned if a function does not feature a return statement.  
  
**initialization:** An assignment that gives an initial value to a variable that will be updated, such as `x = 0`.  
  
**update:** An assignment where the new value of the variable depends on the old, such as `x = x + 1`.
  
**increment:** An update that increases the value of a variable (often by one).
